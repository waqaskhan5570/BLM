                      Many have made this “tik tok language” or “gen z language”
                      a part of their daily conversations. This “genz language”
                      is actually AAVE (African American Vernacular English).
                      AAVE has a deep rooted history and when non-native
                      speakers mimic it, they are embodying negative stereotypes
                      that are associated with african americans.

                <p>
                  Last summer your friend and many others posted a black screen
                  on their instagram feed with the # “blackout tuesday” or
                  “blm”. Following that, some continued to post resources and
                  petitions about BLM while others have not said anything since.
                  Do you see anything wrong with someone not posting anything
                  after the black square?

                      Absolutely. This is performance activism and with no
                      follow up you are one of the many just hopping onto a
                      “trend”

                      Although many choose not to use social media frequently,
                      just posting a black square with no follow up can be very
                      harmful to people of the black community. While you
                      acknowledge the movement it doesn’t provide people with
                      the resources they need to promote change.

                      One US study found that job resumes with traditionally
                      white-sounding names received 50% more callbacks than
                      those with traditionally Black names. <br />
                      In the US, Black workers are less likely than white
                      workers to be employed in a job that is consistent with
                      their level of education. <br />

                      On average, Black men in the US receive sentences that are

                      Confining the history of an entire race of people to a

                      their contributions but also allows the greater truth to

                      Blackface is much more than just dark makeup used to
                      enhance a costume. Its American origins can be traced to
                      minstrel shows. In the mid to late nineteenth century,
                      white actors would routinely use black grease paint on
                      their faces when depicting plantation slaves and free
                      blacks on stage.To be clear, these weren't flattering
                      representations. At all. Taking place against the backdrop
                      of a society that systematically mistreated and
                      dehumanized black people, they were mocking portrayals
                      that reinforced the idea that African-Americans were
                      inferior in every way.

                      Representation matters within the slightest things, but
                      affects our entire psyche.The word “black” represents an
                      extremely diverse group of people, spanning a wide
                      geographical area and a broad range of religious beliefs,
                      ethnicities and languages. However, there seems to always
                      be a flawed portrayal of our community in society, turning
                      what should be a beautiful mosaic into a uniform canvas.
                      This monotonous depiction of the black community often
                      presents black people in a negative light. This affects
                      not only how others in society perceive them but also
                      affects how they view themselves. <br />
                      Black people are often subjected to social labels and
                      expectations for the entirety of our lives. A recent study
                      from Yale University revealed that many preschool teachers
                      have implicit biases against black students, resulting in
                      lower expectations and gifted-program referrals rates for
                      these students. Black people are subjected to harmful
                      stereotypes even as early as infancy. Such stereotypes
                      persist throughout a black person’s life — in youth, where
                      we are viewed as thugs or troublemakers, up until
                      adulthood, where we are disproportionately represented in
                      the criminal justice system.

            <p>
              Black Lives Matter is a decentralized political and social
              movement protesting against incidents of police brutality and all
              racially motivated violence against black people.
            </p>
            <h4>#Blacklivesmatter</h4>

            <p>
              In July 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag
              #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George
              Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon
              Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. The movement became
              nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014
              deaths of two African Americans, that of Michael Brown—resulting
              in protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a city near St.
              Louis—and Eric Garner in New York City.

            <p>
              Black lives matter – now and always. Critics of the movement have
              tried to argue that the title should be ‘All Lives Matter’.
              However, this misses the point of the movement. No one questions
              whether White lives matter – society has accepted that as a given.
              <br />
              <br />
              Black lives, on the other hand, are the ones questioned and in
              danger. Their lives need fighting for. Saying that Black lives
              matter does not make non-Black lives matter any less. Another way
              to look at the movement title is: Black Lives Matter Too.
